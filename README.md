C++ code using ncurses to make a (mostly) functional editor. Selection has not been implemented, and color mode "programming" doesn't yet work. I know my code is not very clean, but I am working on separating it into several files and making it faster
and cleaner.

I have attached the source code and the executable file.

To compile the program yourself, you need g++ and ncurses downloaded this syntax is needed for linux command line (things in <> should be replaced by the names you want:

g++ <name of .cpp program> -lncurses -o <name and/or path you want the output to have>

When pressing ESC the designated amount of times, wait a couple seconds before pressing anything.
